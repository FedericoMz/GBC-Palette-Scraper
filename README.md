The Game Boy Color featured default palettes for certain original Game Boy games, along with an additional 12 palettes accessible through button combinations during game launch. As a bonus, a few unused palettes were also included!

This straightforward script extracts palettes from https://tcrf.net/Notes:Game_Boy_Color_Bootstrap_ROM and transforms them into .pal format compatible with the Analogue Pocket.

Within the three folders, you'll find all the official palettes. Here's how to make use of them (from Analogue [documentation](https://www.analogue.co/developer/docs/custom-palettes#)):

    Place .pal files on the SD card in the folder /Assets/gb/common/palettes
    Enter Settings>Pocket>Systems>GB>Video>Color Palettes and select Custom, then Load Custom.
    Select a file from the list.
